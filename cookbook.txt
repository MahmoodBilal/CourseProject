This file describes the step-by-step process to create the Getting and Cleaning Data project assignment.

Data Source:
The site where is data was obtained
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Data for the Project is available at
	https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Getting data from source:
	Get the data from the source above and store it in home directory\data
	Note: (The source is a ZIP file, so it is important to extract it)
 
run_analysis.R script performs the following steps to clean the sample data and generate two files merged.txt and data_with_mean.txt

1.	Set the working directory to Home directory\Data

2.	Get the required files
	a.	Read X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject.txt files from /data/train and store them in Xtrain.Data, ytrain.Data and subtrain.Data variables respectively.
	b.	Read X_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt files from /data/test and store them in Xtest.Data, ytest.Data and subtest.Data variables respectively.

3.	Join Data
	a.	Join data of train and test variables for each X, y and Subject and store them in join.XData, join.yData and join.SubData variables
	b.	Name the join.SubData column to “subject”

4.	Extract only mean and standard deviation from the features
	a.	Get the all the possible features from data/features.txt and store them in features variables
	b.	Extract the indices of only Mean and Standard deviation features
	c.	Extract only relevant features from join.XData variable and store them in join.XData
	d.	Name the columns to the relevant features.
	e.	Clean the feature data by removing the “-” and make mean and std first character capital

5.	Uses descriptive activity names for the activities
	a.	Get the all the subject activities from data/activity_labels.txt and store them in activity variables
	b.	Remove “_” from the second column (activitylabels)
	c.	Transform the values of join.yData according to the activity data frame
	d.	Name the join.yData as “activity” 

6.	Create and store tidy data set
	a.	Combine all datasets (join.subData, join.yData and join.XData) once all data sets are cleaned up into a tidyData variable
	b.	Write the newly created tidyData data frame out to the home directory and named as tidydata.txt  

7.	Create tidy data set with the average of each included variable for each activity and each subject.
	a.	Group the subject and activity to calculate the Mean value for all included variables and store them in tidyData_WithMean data frame
	b.	Write the results out to the tidyData_Wtihmeans.txt file with no row names in working directory
